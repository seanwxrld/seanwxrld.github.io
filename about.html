        <h1>Precision, narrative, intention.</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          SĒAN MOSIKILI (born Tswelopele Sean Mosikili, April 11, 2005) is a South African-born singer,
          songwriter, and producer. His work incorporates elements of dark pop, alternative pop, and
          contemporary R&B, built on vocal layering, atmospheric production, and narrative songwriting.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            SĒAN began writing music at the age of eight. During secondary education, he received
            formal instruction in music theory, piano performance, and vocals. After high school, he
            deepened his skill set through independent study in production, audio engineering, and
            advanced songwriting, assuming full responsibility for the technical and artistic aspects
            of his recordings.

          <h2>Artistic Focus</h2>
          <p>
            The work explores identity, emotional intimacy, self-worth, and personal development with
            a restrained, minimalist palette. Visual direction is equally intentional, informed by his
            background in fashion design and a preference for clean, editorial aesthetics.

          <h2>Debut Era</h2>
          <p>
            In January 2026, SĒAN MOSIKILI released his debut single, <strong>ALL MINE</strong>, as the lead
            single from the album <strong>TWĒNTY</strong>. The album documents the transition from emotional
            imbalance to clarity, tracing the pressure of youth and the moment where growth begins to
            outweigh uncertainty.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Independent Control</h2>
          <p>
            SĒAN currently operates as an independent artist, directing songwriting, production, and
            engineering across his releases. Each project is designed as a chapter of a larger narrative
            that prioritizes emotional precision over excess.
